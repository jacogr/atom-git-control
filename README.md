# Atom git-control

## What

Provides a GUI interface to manage all commonly-used git commands.

This is a first-release, while tested as part of creating this package, it has not been extensively used on much larger projects. In short: there are possibly still some issues remaining. At the same time, wanted to get the package out there and used.
